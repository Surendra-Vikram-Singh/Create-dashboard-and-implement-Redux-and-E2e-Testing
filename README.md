# Angular Application

This project is an Angular application that includes unit and end-to-end (E2E) testing using Jasmine, Karma, and Cypress. This README provides instructions for setting up, running, and writing tests for the application.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/surendra38/-Kugelblitz-Assignment.git>
    cd <master>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

1. **Serve the application:**

    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Unit Testing

Unit tests are written using Jasmine and Karma. They are used to test individual components and services in isolation.

1. **Write Unit Tests:**

    Unit tests for components and services should be placed in `.spec.ts` files alongside their respective files. These tests focus on verifying the functionality of specific methods, components, and interactions.

2. **Run Unit Tests:**

    To run unit tests and generate a test report:

    ```bash
    ng test
    ```

    This command uses Karma to execute tests in a browser and provides feedback on test results.

## Setting Up E2E Testing with Cypress

1. **Install Cypress:**

    Install Cypress as a development dependency:

    ```bash
    npm install cypress --save-dev
    ```

2. **Initialize Cypress:**

    Run the command to generate Cypress configuration files and folders:

    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```

    This will create a `cypress` folder with the necessary directories.

3. **Configure Angular for Cypress:**

    Update the `angular.json` file to use Cypress for E2E testing by configuring the `e2e` section to utilize Cypress. This involves specifying Cypress as the testing framework and adjusting the configuration to suit your application.

## Writing Cypress Tests

1. **Create Cypress Test Files:**

    Write E2E tests in the `cypress/integration` directory. These tests simulate user interactions and validate the end-to-end functionality of the application, including navigation, data display, and user input handling.

2. **Test Structure:**

    Structure your test files to group related tests. Use descriptive names and ensure each test verifies a specific aspect of the application, such as page navigation, component rendering, or data interactions.

## Running Cypress Tests

1. **Run Cypress Tests:**

    To execute the E2E tests in headless mode:

    ```bash
    npx cypress run
    ```

    To open the Cypress Test Runner for an interactive experience:

    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```

    The interactive mode allows you to see the tests running in real-time and provides a user-friendly interface for debugging.

## Configuration

1. **Configure Base URL and Settings:**

    Set the base URL and other configurations in the `cypress.json` file. This file allows you to customize Cypress settings, such as base URL and video recording options.

2. **Angular Configuration:**

    Ensure that all necessary modules and components are properly declared in the Angular application to avoid errors during testing.
